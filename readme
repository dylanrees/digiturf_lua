ONGOING DESIGN STUFF

When a territory "rebels" and declares independence, it shows up as a spreading
wave of random coloration within a territory, followed by a white flash, an
exploding sound, and the creation of new borders.


FITNESS FUNCTION

The way the AI works is that each NPC has a fitness function that computes
total fitness of the player based on a series of factors:

1.) Ratio of total surface area to volume of the player's territory
2.) Color variation in the player's territory
3.) Total number of squares the player controls
4.) Total number of squares the opponents control

The player does a survey of the entire board, flags all spaces that, if claimed,
would increase the fitness of the player, picks one, and does it.

As players spawn other players, the new players inherit their fitness functions
from the old ones.  Small tweaks are made to the coefficients in front of each
of the factors in the fitness function.  The "intelligence" is also tweaked
up or down.

If intelligence is at 100%, that player will always choose the move that
maximizes its fitness function.  If it's at 0%, that player will choose
a random legal move.  If it's at X%, the player will from chose from a list of
all moves that have an effect on the fitness function that is more that X% of the way between
the worst move and the best move.
